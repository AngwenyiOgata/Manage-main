## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

How to use css pseudo-classes.
How to do a flexslider in JavaScript.
Plain Javascript simple form validation

```css
.app__footer section section ul li:not(:last-child){
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
```

### Continued development

For now am doing more projects that involve some `JS` to enhance my skills in `Js`. Also do more work on my `CSS` skills as I think that i write alot of `CSS` code in my projects though i try to make them be responsive as much as possible and look amazing on diffrent screen sizes.
